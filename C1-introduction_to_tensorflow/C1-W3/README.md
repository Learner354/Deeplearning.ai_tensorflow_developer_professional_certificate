##  Assignment Completed

### 1. **CNN for Fashion MNIST Classification**
- Built a CNN with `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers
- Used Fashion MNIST dataset with reshaped input (28, 28, 1)
- Compared accuracy to previous fully connected models

 **Model Architecture:**
```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
